This was a senior software engineering project where we as a small group had to design a whole website, front and back end, from the ground up.  We chose a simple job search website focusing primarily on
ideally focusing on comp sci jobs for recent college grads.  I was mostly responsible for writing most of the test cases in our testing suite, some UML diagrams and the user stories/documentation, 
but everyone did a bit of everything.
