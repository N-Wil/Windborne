My favorite project in school, I found it to be by far the most interesting.  Done for a senior Intro to AI class, this code represents the logic behind a simple mancala-playing AI that was our final project.
We used an A* based algorithm and had to implement our own heuristics to get our AI agents to play better than others in the class, which were then played against each other in a single-elimination style
tournament. The project (and whole class) was written in LISP which I also thoroughly enjoyed learning.
